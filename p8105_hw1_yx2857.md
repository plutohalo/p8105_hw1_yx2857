**Problem 1**

The dataset, *penguins*, stores information of penguins, including
species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass,
sex, and year. The *penguin* dataset has 8 columns and 344 rows.  
The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm.  
Another dataset, *penguins_raw*, stores more detailed information of the
penguins, including the study name, sample number, region, individual
ID, and other details. The *penguins_raw* dataset has 17 columns and 344
rows.

**Problem 2**  
Dataset “store” is created as follows:

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    balance good  staff manager
    ##      <dbl> <lgl> <chr> <fct>  
    ##  1  0.674  TRUE  a     a      
    ##  2  1.31   TRUE  b     b      
    ##  3  0.115  TRUE  c     c      
    ##  4  1.07   TRUE  d     a      
    ##  5  0.155  TRUE  e     b      
    ##  6  2.12   TRUE  f     c      
    ##  7 -0.219  FALSE g     a      
    ##  8 -0.113  FALSE h     b      
    ##  9 -0.0651 FALSE i     c      
    ## 10  0.476  TRUE  j     a

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and
what doesn’t?

    ## [1] "Mean of variable, 'balance'"

    ## [1] 0.5520184

    ## [1] "Mean of variable, 'good'"

    ## [1] 0.7

    ## [1] "Mean of variable, 'staff'"

    ## [1] NA

    ## [1] "Mean of variable, 'manager'"

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean works for the numeric and logical variables, `balance`
and `good`, but not for the variable `staff` or `manager`, which are
character and factor variables respectively.

``` r
# Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try to take the mean?

# logical
as.numeric(pull(store, good))
# character
as.numeric(pull(store, staff))
# factor
as.numeric(pull(store,manager))
```

When applying the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and
factor variables, the logical variable `good` is converted to 0 and 1,
the character variable `staff` is converted to `NA`, and the factor
variable `manager` is converted to the integer representation of the
factor levels. This helps explain what happens when trying to take the
mean of these variables. The `mean` function only works for numeric and
logical variables, and it will not work for character or factor
variables.
